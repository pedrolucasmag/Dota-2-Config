This should provide rough syntax highlighting for gaming configs in Notepad++.
I've tested this with the configs from games I play and it's working fine. 
Colours need tweaked.

1. To install this, in Notepad++ go to:
	View -> User-Defined Dialogue -> Import -> Find and select gameconfigs.xml

2. To use:
	Notepad++ should automatically use this language file for .cfg files.
	Otherwise, open the file you're editing, then go to Language -> Game Configs.
